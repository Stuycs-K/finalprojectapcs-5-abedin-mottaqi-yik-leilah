# Project Description

Our project is our own version of Plants vs Zombies. Although we only have one level, it is complete with waves and randomization, so (almost) every playthrough is different! 

We have created our own sprites for zombies and plants, and have added additional sprites to some plants (non-wallnuts) to better show their status. Every entity (plants, zombies) has at least 3 sprites that show how much health it has. 

We have also drawn our own starting screen, win screen, and loss screen. We have also included the existing pause screen in the game, but ours is slightly different. Our starting screen mimics the classic start screen/loading screen. Our lose screen also does this, and is extremely similar to the Plants vs Zombies 2 losing screen. However, our win screen is a completely new design, featuring Crazy Dave's taco. This is a reference to its significance throughout the games (it drives Crazy Dave on a time travel journey to eat it again it in PvZ2). 

Our game features 3 types of zombies: Normal Zombie, Flag Zombie, and Conehead Zombie. All of our zombies differ from the original game, as they are riding skateboards. 

Our game features 3 different plants: Sunflower, Peashooter, and Wallnut. All of these plants function the same as those in the original game, however (as previously mentioned), their sprites change on how much health they have. 

We have included the standard features of Plants vs Zombies. We have naturally spawning sun, lawnmowers, and a shovel to remove plants. Our plants also have cooldowns, similar to seed packet refreshes in the actual game.

We have also illustrated our own lawnmowers, suns, peas, and game background. They draw heavy inspiration from the real game. 

# Intended usage:

To start playing our game, click anywhere in the Processing Sketch on the start screen. 

Click on the desired button to select a plant. The selected button should have a colored background. Then, press a square on the grid to place the plant in. You can only place a plant when you have enough sun to afford it. 

Collect sun by clicking it while it is falling, when it lands, or when sunflowers spawn it. 

To remove plants, click the shovel icon. If you have done this successfully, the shovel button should turn red. Then, click on the plant you would like to remove. 

Press 'p' to pause the game. Press 'p' to unpause the game.

Press 's' to gain 100 sun. Press 'k' to kill all zombies. 

Press the 'Restart' button in the pause screen, win screen, or loss screen to restart the game.
