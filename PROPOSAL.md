# Final Project Proposal

## Group Members:

Mottaqi Abedin and Leilah Yik

# IDEAS:

1. Plants vs Zombies, but we only have 3 variations of zombies and plants unlocked in the normal daytime levels (e.g. peashooter, sunflower, walnut, chomper).

2. Chess, but you play against a really dumb AI that can bend the rules (e.g. bringing back lost pieces, moves pieces incorrectly).

3. Suika Game (tetris x 2048 with fruits that merge and pop).
