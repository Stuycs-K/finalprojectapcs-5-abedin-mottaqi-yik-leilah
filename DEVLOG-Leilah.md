### 2025-05-22 - UML Diagram
Spent entire class and 30 mins at home revising UML Diagram. May need to make further changes.

### 2025-05-23 - Zombies and UML
Spent class time revisiting UML Diagaram/plan with Mr. K. Made changes to UML Diagram and did work on zombies.

### 2025-05-26 - More UML + More Classes + Methods
Worked on UML Diagram (still updating, didn't put it on GitHub yet). Added Displayable class for zombies and plants (and others we may want to show). Worked on Displayable class, Zombie class, and NormalZombie. Added Interactable and NormalSun files as well as some notes on them.

### 2025-05-27 - Fixing Everything
Fixed inconsistencies and things that didn't make sense with what methods were in what class, whether things were abstract classes/interfaces, what should/shouldn't be an instance variable. Removed Sun file because we're using PlayerSun instead.

Worked on finding starting numbers for the game (PlayerSun starting amount, zombie/plant stats). Added more to the game class as well as what we put in our updated UML Diagram that I haven't uploaded yet. Added wave class for the levels. Worked on board class. Worked on UIManager.

### 2025-05-28 - Plant work
Tried to work on plants. First worked on peashooter and attempted work on projectile and its spawning. Adjusted Sunflower class.

### 2025-05-29 - Plants and Zombies
Mostly worked on trying to fix classes like Plant (+ related - Peashooter, Sunflower), Zombie. Updated UML Diagram. Also worked on NrmalSun. Did a lot of stuff with cooldowns. Worked on update for projectile.

### 2025-05-30 - Plants and Zombies
Attempted to fix zombie class so that it actually functions as an entity in processing. Modified files to adapt to processing. Fixed peashooter constructor and worked on cooldowns.

### 2025-06-01 - NormalSun and (scrapped) HealthBar
Fixed sun so that it doesn't fall on sunflowers and that it stops falling to a certain (random) pos in the lawn. Adding a healthbar.

### 2025-06-02 - Sprites
Spent class time working on creating sprites for the game. Decided not to add healthbar to stay true to the game. Finished sunflower sprites with varying health values. Finished peashooter sprites with varying health values. Need to finish super injured wallnut. 

### 2025-06-02 - Sprites: Lawnmower and Zombie
