### 2025-05-22 - UML Diagram
Spent entire class and 30 mins at home revising UML Diagram. May need to make further changes.

### 2025-05-23 - Zombies and UML
Spent class time revisiting UML Diagaram/plan with Mr. K. Made changes to UML Diagram and did work on zombies.

### 2025-05-26 - More UML + More Classes + Methods
Worked on UML Diagram (still updating, didn't put it on GitHub yet). Added Displayable class for zombies and plants (and others we may want to show). Worked on Displayable class, Zombie class, and NormalZombie. Added Interactable and NormalSun files as well as some notes on them.

### 2025-05-27 - Fixing Everything
Fixed inconsistencies and things that didn't make sense with what methods were in what class, whether things were abstract classes/interfaces, what should/shouldn't be an instance variable. Removed Sun file because we're using PlayerSun instead.

Worked on finding starting numbers for the game (PlayerSun starting amount, zombie/plant stats). Added more to the game class as well as what we put in our updated UML Diagram that I haven't uploaded yet. Added wave class for the levels. Worked on board class. Worked on UIManager.
