# Technical Details:

A description of your technical design. This should include:

How you will be using the topics covered in class in the project.


We will be creating our version of Plants vs Zombies, which is a tower defense game where players have to use plants to defend their house from an onslaught of zombies. Unfortunately, due to the existing game's complexity, we will have to dumb it down by reducing the varieties of plants and zombies, and we will not be adding features like powerups from Plants vs Zombies 2.

After 1.5 weeks, we want to have added the Sunflower, Peashooter, and Normal Zombie. They should all function as intended (sunflowers should generate collectible sun, peashooters should launch ranged attacks, normal zombies should eat plants and trigger a defeat screen when they reach the house). At this point in time, we should have at least one playable level.

By the end, it would be nice to have added more plant and zombie types (e.g. walnut, repeater, torchwood, conehead zombie, buckethead zombie, screen door zombie, imp), natural sun generation, lawnmowers, the shovel feature, and sprites/animations for plant and zombie statuses (attacking, eating/being eaten, injured, etc.).It would also be nice to have a start/level selection screen and an endless mode. If we're ambitious, we could also add the last stand mode, where the player starts with a set amount of sun and has to plan their defense to defeat the zombies.

Some things we will use that we have learned from class are interfaces and classes.
